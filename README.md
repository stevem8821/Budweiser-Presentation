# Budweiser-Presentation
This is the Repository for Case Study 1: Budweiser Presentation

The purpose of the project is to answer the questions asked of me by the CEO of Budweiser, Mr. Carlos Brito, and to provide any further insight beyond these questions.
To address the questions asked by Mr. Brito, I utilized RStudio to perform statistical and visual analysis of the data. See "Budweiser_Presentation.html" for all code used
in the analysis, as well as outputs of said code.

Files contained with are:

1. Beer.csv - a csv file with the beer data given to me by Mr. Brito.
2. Breweries.csv - a csv file with the brewery data given to me by Mr. Brito.
3. Budweiser_Presentation.pptx - a powerpoint file with slides that are used in my presentation to Mr. Brito.
4. Budweiser_Presentation.Rmd - an R Markdown file containing the R code used to develop the insights used in my presentation to Mr. Brito.
5. Budweiser_Presentation.html - an html file containing the R code complete with charts and outputs used to develop the insights used in my presentation to Mr. Brito.
